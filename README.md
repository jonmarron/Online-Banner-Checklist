# Online-Banner-Checklist
I did my Frontend training in order to be able to code Online Banners at my present job, make landing pages and websites at work and thus vamp my value as a Graphic Designer/Web Developer. So when I came back, i dove right into it, mostly coding Online Banners in a weekly basis.  There are a bunch of guidelines I easily forgot/didn't even know they were there.  Anyway, in order to avoid this I made myself a checklist so I can track my progress and not forget anything.   This web application saves the list points in localStorage so I can track it on my computer while I am coding. It also rmembers if you set it on Dark or Light mode.
